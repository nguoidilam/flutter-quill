# Localizations Setup
in addition to the required delegatess which mentioned above in [Using custom app widget](./using_custom_app_widget.md)

which are:
```dart
localizationsDelegates: const [
    DefaultCupertinoLocalizations.delegate,
    DefaultMaterialLocalizations.delegate,
    DefaultWidgetsLocalizations.delegate,
],
```
which are used by offical flutter widgets

The library also needs the 
```dart
// Required localizations delegates ...
FlutterQuillLocalizations.delegate
```

To offer the default localizations.

But **you don't have to** since we have wraped the `QuillEditor` and `QuillToolbar` with `FlutterQuillLocalizationsWidget` which will check if it sets then it will go, if not, then it will be provided only for them, so it's not really required, but if you are overriding the `localizationsDelegates` you could also add the `FlutterQuillLocalizations.delegate`
which won't change anything
